Smaller imports: the source is now one file per component. Five grouped files (`extra`, `forms`, `feedback`, `layout`, `layout2`) held 8, 6, 5, 5 and 7 components each, so importing one of them pulled in its file-mates. Measured, gzipped: Skeleton 8.3 → 0.5 kB, Card 6.3 → 0.5 kB, Stack 6.9 → 0.5 kB, Avatar 6.3 → 0.6 kB, Tooltip 6.0 → 0.9 kB, Badge 8.3 → 3.2 kB, TextField 6.1 → 5.4 kB, DatePicker 10.5 → 9.7 kB; the whole library is unchanged at ~34 kB. `Card only` and `Skeleton only` joined the size gate so this can't regress. Code moved, nothing else: all 49 fixtures server-render to byte-identical HTML and the published types are identical (only their order changed).
