Four additions for everyday admin and booking screens:

- **`Combobox multiple`** — pick any number; picks show as removable chips, the list stays open between picks, Backspace removes the last, `max` caps the count, `name` posts one hidden input per value. `value`/`onChange` are `string[]` (typed separately from the single mode, which is unchanged).
- **`NumberField`** — an ARIA spinbutton with thousands separators, `prefix`/`suffix` (`฿`, `%`, `ชิ้น`), `min`/`max`/`step`/`decimals`, ↑/↓ and PageUp/PageDown, +/− buttons that stop at the bounds; clamps and formats when you leave it. Works with react-hook-form `Controller`.
- **`Stepper`** — progress through a multi-step flow; the current step has `aria-current="step"`, completed steps can link back (`onStepClick`), horizontal or vertical; on phones a horizontal stepper shows markers plus "Step 2 of 4".
- **`SegmentedControl`** — 2–5 exclusive choices that apply at once (view, period); a radio group with one Tab stop and arrow keys, icons or icon-only, `sm`, `fullWidth`.

All four are on the pilots (Orders: category multi-filter, delivery-scope control, amount field; Settings: setup stepper, working hours via Controller), pass axe in both themes and have behaviour tests. New labels in EN/TH: increase/decrease, step x of y, completed. Size budgets raised on purpose for the new code (whole library 33.8 → 36.0 kB gzip; single imports unchanged).
